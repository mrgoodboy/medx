				<p>The MedX Program seeks to reimagine the undergraduate pre-health experience. We act as a powerful extension of traditional medical science routes, involving students in multi-disciplinary applications of academic work and the realization of service-oriented culture.</p>
				<p>Standing as an alternative to conventional "pre-med" activities, The Program explores a range of increasingly important issues such as physician influence in technological development and comparative health paradigms in international policy. Our goal is twofold: to involve the clinically-oriented in the intersection of medicine and globalization, and to engage others by mapping diverse experiences to the future of healthcare.</p>

					<h3>Execute</h3>
					<h5>Develop a 360 degree overview of the current state of global health care, fostering a holistic understanding of medicine</h5>
					<br>
					<p class="align-left">MedXamine (Education Division) begins the MedX journey by introducing members to remarkably accomplished speakers, charging students as the "supernodes"  of a cross-generational health data student-led research project, and orienting pre-health students with the role of other disciplines in healthcare. We explore applications of health to companies of all types, programs run by on-campus departments, and graduate schools, in addition to acting as consultants for various healthcare organizations. Finally, students contribute to outreach that furthers the interest of medicine at large and their own individual development.</p>

					<h3>Experience</h3>
					<h5>Enter a semester of cross-linked externships, rediscover health on campus, and travel the world.</h5>
					<br>
					<p class="align-left">MedXperience (Externships Division) designs a series of externship experiences designed to give members a snapshot of medicine at work. Whether it is executing on-the-ground work for an international startup, touring a pharmaceuticals company, or assisting a hospital-run medical exchange program halfway across the world, our programs create maximum impact and demand consistent intellectual involvement. Our trips examine healthcare through many lenses, exploring a country's infrastructure and policies as well as medical education and facilities.</p>
