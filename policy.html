		<h3>The Role of Health Policy</h3>
		<p>
		Policy affects all fields and areas of study, whether it is the regulation of fishing industry or national pursuit of international space travel.  Not surprisingly, policy also has a massive effect on all medical realms shaping health regulation and standards, research funding, and medical education. Recently, healthcare policy reforms have dominated headlines around the world and highlighted the need for a medical revolution in the United States. However, the recent reforms are neither the beginning nor the end of health policy.
 		</p>
 		<p>
 			Healthcare and health standards in America still have significant room for improvement. Beyond Americaâ€™s borders, there are giant discrepancies in the standards of health. Consider the fact that roughly forty years separate the average life expectancies of the nation with the highest and the nation with the lowest average life expectancies.  Health policy is an important driver of improvements in health standards across the world. By implementing better vaccination policies, offering increased access to medications and hospital care, and allocating resources more efficiently, we can use health policy to improve the health of entire communities. While the political machinations of Washington can seem impenetrable, students, teachers, and advocacy groups can be tremendously impactful by shining a light on much-needed reform. The Policy branch of The MedX Program seeks to involve students in the charge to lead informed change and innovation in the health policy realm.

		<h3>MedX Execute Program</h3>
		<p>Our team works to hold speaker events, participate in policy campaigns, and work alongside health organizations to influence health policy.  Five intimate, roundtable speaker events are typically scheduled for every upcoming semester, each dealing with policy issues such as:
		</p>

		<ul>
			<li>Managing international medical partnerships</li>
			<li>Translating research to actionable advocacy</li>
			<li>Informing the medical paradigm through comparative modeling</li>
			<li>Discovering points of policy impact across healthcare fields</li>
			<li>The founding of an international global health startup</li>
		</ul>

		<p>
			In addition, chapters can choose to organize and manage campaigns alongside organizations such as Energize the Chain, Universities Allied for Essential Medicines, and the American Medical Student Association. Over the course of the year, Policy divisions develop an experiential understanding of the many facets of health policy. Our keystone topics evolve every semester, and short summaries of our work are given below.
