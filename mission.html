		<h2>Our mission</h2>
		<!-- </header> -->
		<p>The MedX Program was inspired by the broadening responsibilities of the healthcare profession. In an era of rapidly changing technological and business realities, the conventional trifecta of "study, volunteer, and research" does not necessarily prepare pre-medical and pre-health students to engage in all aspects of clinical involvement.</p>

		<p>As an organization, we seek to improve the health realities of local and global underserved communities through interdisciplinary approaches that go beyond traditional volunteering. We draw students from all schools, regions, and nationalities to facilitate new methods of solving health challenges, while fostering a culture of service among those of all backgrounds in the healthcare and pre-health space. We are proponents of health service.</p>
		<ol>
			<li>
				We want to involve already interested students by illuminating diverse applications of their interests and future work.
			</li>
			<li>
				We strive to engage others in the future of healthcare through showcasing an alternative health sciences experience.
			</li>
		</ol>
		

		<blockquote>Ultimately, our organization enables students to discover and develop what motivates their interest in health and medicine: their own X factors.</blockquote>

				<h3>Past perceptions</h3>

				<p>
					There is a need for healthcare professionals who can influence the world beyond the scope of point-of-service care. Opportunities for enacting large-scale, lasting change in the healthcare sector abound, but are often not emphasized or even acknowledged through traditional pre-health curricula and activities.
				</p>
				<p>
					As technology advances and globalization spreads, our modes of social interaction, research methods, and health accountability stand to be fundamentally changed. At MedX, we have designed a program to empower talented students with novel experiences, opportunities, and educational modules relevant to the new future of healthcare. By providing a student-centric forum for non-traditional pre-health education, we set our members apart and position them to take part in the healthcare revolution. 
				</p>
				<p>
					We are developing well-rounded, passionate, and globally aware individuals from the ground up. Join us.
					Essential pre-medical and/or pre-health activities exist within a narrow sphere.
					Academic aptitude and a high MCAT score are more important to success as a physician than empathy, strong ethics, and business know-how.
				</p>
				<p>
					The best career paths for those interested in medicine are limited to practicing as a doctor (MD), nurse (RN), or biomedical researcher (PhD).
				</p>
				<p>
					Those not interested in technical work or able to memorize vast amounts of information are unable to contribute significantly to the future of healthcare.
				</p>
				<p>
					The current paradigm of medical education is sufficient.
