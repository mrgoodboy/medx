		<h3>A Unique Perspective on Health</h3>
		<p>MedX wishes to educate students with wide-ranging interests in health by offering a unique, multivalent understanding of medical science. We design our education curriculum to address health issues through multiple lenses, primarily those of social and behavioral science, technological development, policy, and finance. We believe that an interdisciplinary, comprehensive approach is critical for understanding the rapidly evolving world of modern healthcare. The Education Division thus fosters awareness and insight into a variety of topics, including:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Technological advancements, such as telemedicine and mobile apps, that are reshaping the healthcare system</li>
			<li>Various political, socioemonomic, and technological factors that influence healthcare in countries around the globe</li>
			<li>Impacts of social networks on long-term health behaviors and their role in improving future health outcomes</li>
			<li>Roles of medical practitioners, insurance companies, and policymakers in delivering healthcare to patients</li>
			<li>Financing and management of hospital mergers & acquisitions and corresponding structures of care delivery</li>
			<li>Current university efforts to deliver quality healthcare abroad, such as the Botswana-UPenn partnership (BUP), which addresses health challenges in Botswana by providing care at hospitals and clinics in Botswana as well as training to Botswana healthcare workers, and engaging in both clinical and public health research in Botswana​​</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>Campus Dialogue</h3>
		<p>Our organization recognizes the rich diversity of experience and understanding that can be found both within the organization itself and on campus. To this end, we strive to create opportunities that serve to stimulate discussion and awareness of health-related issues both within our chapters and across campuses. Examples of our work include:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Campus campaigns to generate awareness of global issues of inequity of healthcare quality and access.</li>
			<li>Campus campaigns to open dialogue on topics within pre-medical student culture and access</li>
			<li>Campus-wide educational initiatives that focus on healthcare infrastructure in developing countries</li>
			<li>Collaborations with several student-run organizations to host conferences, programs, and interdisciplinary events</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>Student-Driven Health Data Project</h3>
		<p>Our organization is part of a nation-wide research effort involved in creating a cross-generational model of semantic health ontologies. Selected members of The MedX Program will act as the pilot drivers of social data and health behaviors tracking in the upcoming school year. The goal of our research is to connect MedX student members with older adults, utilizing the technological know-how of our generation to promote positive health behavioral changes in our local environment. Through the analysis of community data, we hope to better understand how Web Ontologies can help shape health outcomes.</p>

		<h3>Guest Seminars</h3>
		<p>Our organization believes that highlighting the rich experiences of others serves as a prime introduction to new material and operations. Examples of past speakers include:</p>

		<ul>
			<li>Physicians in international medicine who have become influential actors in policy</li>
			<li>Medical school students who have done rotations or training programs abroad</li>
			<li>Healthcare consultants and analysts working in supply chain, finance, and operations roles</li>
			<li>Experts involved in the generation and implementation of domestic and international medical policy</li>
			<li>Epidemiology researchers focusing in community health, health dialogues, and policy</li>
			<li>MD/PhD students interested in bridging medicine with the social sciences</li>
			<li>Medical education advocates, journalists, and activists</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>Medical Consulting</h3>
		<p>One of our newest initiatives is medical consulting, which pairs trained MedX consultants with international and local healthcare organizations in need of process realignment, change management, content management, or related services in the business, operational, and technical areas. By working with our partner organizations, we hope to directly apply learned methods in order to explore medical service from many different perspectives.</p>
